# FAQ

Frequently asked questions about Agent Client.

## General

### What is Agent Client?

Agent Client is an Obsidian plugin that lets you chat with AI agents directly within Obsidian. It supports Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Mistral Vibe, and any ACP-compatible agent. The plugin uses the [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) to communicate with agents.

### Is this an official Anthropic/OpenAI/Google plugin?

No. Agent Client is a community-developed plugin. It uses official agent packages but is not affiliated with any AI provider.

### Does this work on mobile?

No. Agent Client is desktop-only. Agents run as local processes, which is not supported on mobile devices.

### Is my data sent to AI providers?

Yes. When you send a message, it's processed by the AI provider behind your selected agent (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.). Review each provider's privacy policy for details.

## Note Mentions

### How do I reference my notes in a conversation?

Type `@` in the input field and a dropdown appears with matching notes. Select a note to insert a mention in `@[[Note Name]]` format. The note's content is sent to the agent.

See [Note Mentions](/usage/mentions) for details.

### Can I change the character limit for mentions?

Yes. Configure **Max note length** and **Max selection length** in **Settings → Agent Client → Mentions**. The default is 10,000 characters each.

### What is auto-mention?

When enabled (**Settings → Agent Client → Mentions → Auto-mention active note**), the currently open note is automatically included as context. Unlike manual mentions, auto-mention only sends the note's file path—not its content. The agent can use its Read tool to access the content if needed.

### Can I include just part of a note?

Yes. If you select text in your note, only that selection is sent as context. The auto-mention badge shows the line range (e.g., `@My Note:5-10`).

### Does the agent see the notes my note links to?

Not their content—but with **Expand wikilink context** (on by default, **Settings → Agent Client → Mentions**), the agent receives the resolved file path (or an unresolved marker) for each `[[wikilink]]` inside a mentioned note, so it can choose which to open with its Read tool. See [Note Mentions](/usage/mentions#expand-wikilink-context).

### How do I temporarily disable auto-mention?

Click the **×** button next to the auto-mention badge above the input field. Click **+** to re-enable it. This only affects the current message.

## Agents

### How do I switch between agents?

Click the **⋮** (ellipsis) menu in the chat header. Under **"Switch agent"**, select the agent you want to use. This is a one-time change for that view only.

To change the default agent for new chat views, go to **Settings → Agent Client → Default agent**.

### Can I run multiple agents at the same time?

Yes. Open multiple chat views using **"Open new chat view"** from the command palette or the **⋮** menu in the chat header. Each view runs an independent agent process.

See [Multi-Session Chat](/usage/multi-session) for details.

### How do I send the same prompt to multiple agents?

Use the **Broadcast** commands:
1. Type your prompt in one chat view
2. Open command palette and run **"Broadcast prompt"** to copy it to all views
3. Run **"Broadcast send"** to send simultaneously

### Where do new chat views open?

By default, new views open in the right pane. You can change this in **Settings → Agent Client → Display → Chat view location** to open in editor tabs or splits instead.

### How do I hide agents I don't use?

Every agent section in **Settings → Agent Client** has an **Enabled** toggle. Turning it off removes the agent from the switch menus, the default-agent dropdown, and the command palette — its settings are kept, so you can re-enable it anytime. At least one agent must stay enabled.

Disabling only hides the agent from lists: already-open chats, restored sessions, and code blocks that pin the agent with `agent:` keep working.

### What is a custom agent?

Any ACP-compatible agent beyond the preset ones (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Mistral Vibe). You can add custom agents in **Settings → Agent Client → Custom agents**. See [Custom Agents](/agent-setup/custom-agents).

### Do all agents support the same features?

No. Features like slash commands, modes, and models depend on the agent. The plugin adapts its UI based on what the agent supports. For example, the mode dropdown only appears if the agent provides multiple modes.

## Slash Commands

### Why don't I see slash commands?

Slash commands are provided by the agent, not the plugin. If the input placeholder doesn't show `/ for commands`, your current agent doesn't support slash commands.

### Why are the commands different from what I expected?

Each agent provides its own commands. Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and Mistral Vibe all have different command sets. Refer to your agent's documentation for available commands.

## Permissions

### Why does the agent ask for permission?

Some agents request permission before performing certain actions (like editing files or running commands). This is a safety feature controlled by the agent.

### Can I auto-approve all permissions?

Yes. Enable **Settings → Agent Client → Permissions → Auto-allow permissions**. Use with caution—this gives agents full access without confirmation prompts.

### Some agents don't ask for permission at all?

Correct. Permission behavior is agent-specific. Some agents may edit files directly without requesting permission.

## Exporting

### How do I export a conversation?

Click the **export button** in the chat header. The conversation is saved as a Markdown file in your vault.

### Where are exports saved?

By default, exports are saved to the `Agent Client` folder in your vault. You can change this in **Settings → Agent Client → Export → Export folder**.

### Can I auto-export conversations?

Yes. Enable **Auto-export on new chat** or **Auto-export on close chat** in export settings.

### Can I customize the frontmatter tag?

Yes. In **Settings → Agent Client → Export → Frontmatter tag**, you can set a custom tag. Nested tags like `projects/agent-client` are supported.

## Session History

### How do I resume a previous conversation?

Click the **History** button (clock icon) in the chat header to open the session history modal. Select a session and click the **Restore** button (play icon) to continue where you left off.

See [Session History](/usage/session-history) for details.

### What's the difference between Restore and Fork?

**Restore** continues the existing session—new messages are added to the same conversation. **Fork** creates a new session branching from that point, leaving the original session unchanged.

### The modal says "This agent does not support session restoration"

Not all agents support session restoration. You can still view and delete locally saved sessions, but you won't be able to restore or fork them with that agent.

### Are my sessions saved automatically?

Yes. The plugin automatically saves session metadata and message history when you send messages. Sessions are stored locally in Obsidian's data folder.

### Can I delete old sessions?

Yes. Open the session history modal and click the **Delete** button (trash icon) on any session. Deletion is permanent.

## Windows

### What is WSL mode?

WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) mode runs agents inside a Linux environment on Windows. Enable it in **Settings → Agent Client → Windows Subsystem for Linux → Enable WSL mode**. This is useful for agents that work better in Linux environments.

### Do I need to specify a WSL distribution?

Only if you have multiple WSL distributions installed and want to use a specific one. Leave it empty to use your default distribution.

## Cost & Billing

### Is Agent Client free?

The plugin itself is free and open source. However, using AI agents may incur costs depending on the agent and your authentication method.

### API key vs account login—what's the difference?

- **API key**: Billed per usage by the AI provider. You pay for what you use.
- **Account login**: Uses your subscription's included usage. May have limits depending on your plan.
